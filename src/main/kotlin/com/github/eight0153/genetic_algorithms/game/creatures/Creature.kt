// TODO: Implement hunger/energy system that acts as a resource pool for performing actions such as moving.
// TODO: Implement a hit points system which decreases with hunger and possibly fighting with other creatures.
// TODO: Make creatures fight each other, or not? Could add pacifist and aggressive traits. Based on these traits
//  creatures may fight over nearby food and potential mates. When fighting certain traits such as size, speed,
//  bravery/cowardice, altruism and greediness could affect the probability that a creature concedes or accepts the 'duel'.
// TODO: Give creatures a sensory range and make them move towards food and perhaps away from threatening creatures
//  (predators,  stronger creatures etc.)
// TODO: Implement a simple search algorithm for creatures. This could be:
//   Pick a point within the creatures sensory range, move to that point, check for food, move towards food if
//   found, otherwise start again.
// TODO: Make creatures with low metabolism (new gene?) to get less energy from food which is spread over a
//  period of time and hunger slower, and creatures with a high metabolism to get a higher instantaneous energy
//  boost from food but hunger quicker.
